## 🌈 Prism – AI-Powered Resume to Portfolio in One Click:-

Prism is an Agentic AI–powered web application that converts a traditional PDF resume into a fully functional, responsive portfolio website in just one click. Built with Streamlit and powered by Google Gemini LLM, Prism generates a clean, modern, and deployment‑ready website package without requiring any frontend development skills.

Developed during my Agentic AI Internship at Innomatics Research Labs, Prism demonstrates the practical application of AI and LLM technologies through automation, usability, and scalable system design.
